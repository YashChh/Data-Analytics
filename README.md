Internship Projects at Zidio Development (May 2024 - August 2024)

This repository contains the projects I completed during my internship with Zidio Development from May 2024 to August 2024. The focus of these projects was on applying machine learning techniques to solve real-world problems related to emotion recognition from speech and customer segmentation.

Projects Overview

1. Emotion Recognition from Speech using LSTM

   Objective: Develop a model to classify emotions from speech data using the Toronto Emotional Speech Set (TESS) dataset.

   Key Features:

   Data Preprocessing: Loading and preparing the TESS dataset.
   
   Feature Extraction: Using Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) to capture relevant audio features.

   Modeling: Implementing an LSTM neural network to recognize emotions.

   Evaluation: Training and testing the model, with performance metrics to assess accuracy.

   Technologies Used: Python, Keras, TensorFlow, librosa, Matplotlib, Seaborn, scikit-learn

   How to Use:

   1. Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
  
   2. Run the notebook to preprocess data, extract features, build the LSTM model, and evaluate its performance.

2. Customer Segmentation Using K-Means Clustering

   Objective: Segment customers based on their purchasing behavior and other characteristics using K-Means clustering.

   Key Features:

   Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing and understanding the customer data.

   Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and scaling data for clustering.

   Clustering: Using the Elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters and applying K-Means.

   Cluster Analysis: Analyzing and visualizing customer segments to derive insights.

   Technologies Used: Python, Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Yellowbrick

   How to Use:

   1. Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
  
   2. Run the notebook to perform EDA, preprocess data, apply K-Means clustering, and analyze the results.

Internship Experience

During my internship at Zidio Development, I gained hands-on experience in machine learning and data science. I worked on real-world datasets, learned advanced techniques in data preprocessing, feature extraction, and model building, and developed strong problem-solving skills by tackling complex tasks in emotion recognition and customer segmentation.
